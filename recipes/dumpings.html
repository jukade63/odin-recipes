    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      These Chinese dumplings are from Liana Cafe House in Seattle's
      International District. They sell these traditional fried pork dumplings
      from a tiny takeout shop but with this recipe, you can see how to make
      them at home!

    <ol>
      <li>

        and ginger in a large bowl until thoroughly combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place a dumpling wrapper on a lightly floured work surface and spoon
        about 1 tablespoon of the filling in the middle. Wet the edge with a
        little water and crimp together forming small pleats to seal the
        dumpling. Repeat to form remaining dumplings
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1 to 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large skillet over
        medium-high heat. Place 8 to 10 dumplings in the pan and cook until
        browned, about 2 minutes per side. Pour in 1 cup of water; cover and
        cook until the dumplings are tender and pork is cooked through, about 5
        minutes.
