    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Kuku sabzi is a traditional Persian dish that is a herb-heavy frittata.
      The egg is really just a binder to hold all of the herbs together, it is
      not the main component of this dish. Serve with flatbread, yogurt, pickled
      onions, feta, and pomegranate seeds. It is wonderful hot, or at room temp.
      Great light lunch or an appetizer for a casual cocktail.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Large leek</li>
      <li>Extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>Large eggs</li>
      <li>Baking powder</li>
      <li>Kosher salt</li>
      <li>Ground turmeric</li>
      <li>Finely chopped fresh parsley</li>
      <li>Chopped fresh cilantro</li>
      <li>cChopped fresh dill</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to cook</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Slice leek in half lengthwise, then thinly slice crosswise.</li>
      <li>
        Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 10-inch, nonstick, broiler-safe skillet over
        medium heat. Add leek and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened
        and cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven's broiler with the rack in the upper third position.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk eggs in a large bowl. Add baking powder, fenugreek, salt, and
        turmeric, and whisk to thoroughly combine. Fold parsley, cilantro, dill,
        and leeks into eggs. Gently stir to combine; the mixture will be mostly
        herbs, with just enough egg to wet the mixture through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in the same skillet over medium heat.
        Add herb mixture and distribute evenly in the pan, smoothing the top.
        Cover and cook, undisturbed, until the bottom and edges are just set,
        about 8 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove cover and transfer to the preheated oven. Cook until the top and
        middle is cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
